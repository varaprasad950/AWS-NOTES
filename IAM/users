IAM user
--------
--------

An user is an entity that you create in aws account so that newly created IAM user can interact with the aws services 


When an Iam user is created, you can give him the aws console access or programmatic access


By default the newly created IAM user do not have any permissions to create /interact with any of the aws services

We can assign the administrative access / just limit him with access to the EC2 or S3, its totally based on what access he requires
to get his task done.

An Iam user can be a person or an application, in most cases it is for an single individual who can use the assigned credentials and interact with aws services

An Iam user can be added to a group and the iam user can obtain all the roles and polices that are assigned to the group

Note: It is highly advised to enable MFA (Multi factor authentication) for the IAM user as it adds an extra layer of protection to our aws account
