We can prevent an EC2 instance from being accidentally Terminated

Enabling Termination Protection will help us prevent if we have choosen an EC2 to delete by mistake. 
As this gives another level of approval to confirm if we can proceed with deletion.

Once, we are pretty sure to go ahead and delete the EC2 instance we should disable the termination protection settings,
as this will allow us to delete the ec2 instance.


Note: In production environments it is advised to Enable termination protection feature.
