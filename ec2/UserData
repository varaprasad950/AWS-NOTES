UserData
----------


UserData ----> You can pass user data while the creation of ec2 instance, the instance is bootstraped with the scripts/commands that are passed to user data.

	       if you want php, maridab or httpd webserver to be readily available right after the instance creation, all these can be installed from userdata section.

	       userdata can be configured only during when the instance is created for the first time, if you want to make any changes to user data, 
	       the instance needs to be stopped and access the userdata to make any changes.
